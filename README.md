## SocketJoy

Use your mobile phone as a virtual xbox controller for your windows or linux pc!

This project relies on work done by @qbolec with [joydiv](https://github.com/qbolec/Joydiv) and the [j2dx](https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/Joy2DroidX-server/) server written by @OzymandiasTheGreat, so huge thanks to them!


**NOTE**: This project is WIP, however as it stands right now you can serve the index.html, connect to it on your local network using your device. Run the j2dx server and add the local address to the CORS allowed list to get the virtual controller up and running.
